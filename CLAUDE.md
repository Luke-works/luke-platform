# luke-platform — working notes

## Documentation (luke-docs)

This repo is documented in the **luke-docs** manual (`Luke-works/luke-docs`, private VitePress site).

**If a change here is _doc-visible_** — a new/removed capability, endpoint, package or service; a
change to architecture, auth, deployment or the tech stack; a status move (in-progress ↔ ready); or
a notable test/CI change — **update the matching page in the same PR/session:**

- Page: `luke-docs/operations/platform.md`
- If status changed, also update `luke-docs/reference/completeness.md` and `luke-docs/guide/fleet-map.md`.

Trivial changes (typos, refactors, dep bumps) don't need a docs edit. Full workflow: `luke-docs/MAINTAINING.md`.
